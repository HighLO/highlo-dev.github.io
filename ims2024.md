# IMS Meeting 2024

On September 12, 2024, the IMS Group gathered at CERN to share recent developments in market surveillance, strengthen collaboration between institutions, and demonstrate new tools supporting the future of financial market oversight.

## About the IMS

The International Expert Group for Market Surveillance (IMS) is a platform connecting regulators, exchanges, and researchers to advance the field of market surveillance through knowledge sharing, technical innovation, and collaboration. The IMS operates independently and focuses on practical solutions grounded in scientific methods. The 2024 meeting took place on the CERN campus in Geneva, Switzerland.

## Demonstration of MSA Lab

The meeting featured a demonstration of the Market Surveillance Analytics Lab (MSA Lab), a new scientific framework for developing, validating, and deploying manipulation detection methodologies. All IMS members were able to participate in a live demo using their own devices, exploring the Lab's capabilities in real-time.

More information about the MSA Lab can be found at [highlo.org/msalab](https://highlo.org/msalab).

## Presentations by IMS Members

Several IMS members shared their latest research and operational developments:

* **Deutsche BÃ¶rse**: Julian Wagner presented recent developments on spoofing and anti-spoofing enforcement, particularly in relation to evolving EU law.
* **CONSOB**: Carlo Milia discussed the legal challenges associated with the use of artificial intelligence in the detection of market abuse.
* **EEX**: Chris Becker presented new alerts based on Limit Order Book (LOB) imbalance and the surveillance practice known as "advancing the bid."
* **HighLO Project**: Tarek Alskaif provided insights into the functioning of energy markets, challenges faced in surveillance, and the ongoing developments within Project HighLO.

## Visit to the Antimatter Factory

Following the technical sessions, participants visited CERN's Antimatter Factory, where cutting-edge physics research inspired further reflections on scientific collaboration and innovation. The day concluded with a dinner at Le Socrate in Geneva, offering an opportunity to continue discussions in an informal setting.

## Reflections on the Meeting

The 2024 IMS Meeting highlighted the importance of cross-sector collaboration, combining operational expertise, legal insights, and technical innovation. The open exchange of ideas and live demonstrations underscored the group's commitment to advancing market surveillance practices in a rapidly evolving landscape. We sincerely thank all participants for their valuable contributions and look forward to building on the initiatives discussed.
