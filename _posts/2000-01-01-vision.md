# About

Project **High** Energy Physics Tools in **L**imit **O**rder Book Analysis (HighLO) applies particle physics methodologies and tools to financial market data. We aim to identify malicious trading behavior such as market manipulation, to better protect markets. 

Our research enables governments, regulators, exchanges and market participants to better understand what happens when malicious trading occur, and how to respond. New diagnostic tools can be developed to, for example, predict financial instability which will indirectly help to better manage risk. Surveillance agencies can use these insights to create safer and more stable trading environments, leading to improved market regulation and integrity.
