# Vision

Project HighLO aims to identify malicious anomalies that can harm financial markets, so these markets can be better protected. Specifically, particle physics tools are applied to financial market data, to interdisciplinary develop new methodologies to identify and detect manipulation. Insights gained from Project HighLO can be used by governments and regulators to create safer and more stable environments for trading, leading to improved regulation and market integrity. It enables to better understand what happens when malicious anomalies occur, and how they should respond to it. New diagnostic tools can be developed from these insights to predict financial instability, which will indirectly help to better manage risk.
