## Vision

### Research

This collaboration combines methodology and tools from high energy physics and economy,
using techniques traditionally applied in big data analysis, including high-throughput machine learning.
                                
### For Society

The collaboration wants to improve the positive societal impact of markets such as future markets,
while reducing the negative effects of fraud.
                            
### Goals

Research results are published. The technology that led to these results are shared with participating regulators.
This will lead to fairer, more transparent markets.
                                
### Questions

The collaboration will answer long-standing questions in finance, such as "are the rules governing financial markets sufficient?"
and "are state-of-the-art finance metrics statsictically justified and motivated?"
