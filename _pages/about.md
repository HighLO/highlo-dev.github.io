Project HighLO (High Energy Physics Tools in Limit Order Book Analysis) aims to help protect commodity and financial markets from fraud. It combines multiple disciplines, such as particle physics and finance, to identify malicious behavior that can harm the integrity of these markets. Advanced data analytics are used to identify anomalies and diagnose manipulation. Insights gained from Project HighLO can be used by governments and regulators to create safer and more stable environments for trading, leading to improved regulation and market integrity. New diagnostic tools can be developed from these insights to predict financial instability, which will indirectly help to better manage risk.

Project HighLO is a collaboration between [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/), the [Commodity Risk Management Expertise Center](http://cormec.eu/) (CORMEC) and the [European Organization for Nuclear Research](https://home.cern/) (CERN).
